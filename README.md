## Fixes & Bugs

- The calculator will give you results in doubles which means there will always be a point zero at the end.
- If a user tries some weird mathematics, it might not respond or crash, not all measures have been implimented to prevent crafty users
- The design is currently like that till I figure out a way to change it, it was my second day seriously using netbeans are coding in java 

## Updates

- Users can now use the percent and Pi symbol to calculate their designer values.
- The bottom left corner shows the previous calculation that the user was working on.

## Screenshots
- This is the divide action clearly illustrated at the bottom left.

## Notes
- If you want to find percentage, simply click the % button after you calculate.. for example 80x40 which is 3200 then click the % symbol to get the percentage.
- If you want to find Pi then it is as simple as writing the first number then clicking the π symbol.. for example if you want to find the Pi and have the diameter of a cicle, multiply it by Pi.. we'll go with 7 so click 7 then π.
