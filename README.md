## Fixes & Bugs

- The calculator will give you results in doubles which means there will always be a point zero at the end.
- If a user tries some weird mathematics, it might not respond or crash, not all measures have been implimented to prevent crafty users
- The design is currently like that till I figure out a way to change it, it was my second day seriously using netbeans are coding in java 

## Updates

- Users can now use the percent and Pi symbol to calculate their designer values.
- The bottom left corner shows the previous calculation that the user was working on.
